Description: Flexible and Exchangeable BLAS library.
 The FlexiBLAS library is a flexible BLAS wrapper
 which allows one to exchange the system wide BLAS
 implementation without recompiling or relinking programs.
 Even dealing with runtime-loader specific tricks is
 not necessary with FlexiBLAS.
 .
 You can select the BLAS implementation which is used behind
 FlexiBLAS using a configuration file or a environment variable.
 It is integrated in Debian/Ubuntu using the update-alternatives
 mechanism.
 .
 The package supports OpenBLAS, ATLAS and the reference Netlib
 implementation. If you compile FlexiBLAS on your own, other
 BLAS implementations like the old GotoBLAS or the Intel MKL
 are supported.
 .
 This package contains the runtime part of FlexiBLAS.
