flexiblas-api \- Overview about the FlexiBLAS API

.SH SYNOPSIS
\fB#include <flexiblas/flexiblas_api.h>\fR

.SH DESCRIPTION
The FlexiBLAS library provides an additional API beside the BLAS interface. This interface
can be used to switch the number of threads during the runtime or even completely change the
used backend. The functions are categorized into three sections:
.SS Information Functions
.IP \- 3
\fBflexiblas_getversion\fR (3), Version information
.IP \- 3
\fBflexiblas_print_loaded_backends\fR (3), Print information about loaded backends.
.IP \- 3
\fBflexiblas_print_avail_backends\fR (3), Print information about the available backends.
.IP \- 3
\fBflexiblas_print_current_backend\fR (3), Print the currently loaded backend.

.SS Backend Management Functions
.IP \- 3
\fBflexiblas_list\fR (3), Retrieve a list of all available backends.
.IP \- 3
\fBflexiblas_list_loaded\fR (3), Retrieve a list of all loaded backends.
.IP \- 3
\fBflexiblas_load_backend\fR (3), Load a backends from the FlexiBLAS configuration.
.IP \- 3
\fBflexiblas_load_backend_library\fR (3), Load a backends from a shared library.
.IP \- 3
\fBflexiblas_switch\fR (3), Switch to a previously loaded backend.
.IP \- 3
\fBflexiblas_current_backend\fR (3), Return the name of the currently loaded backend.

.SS Interfaces Into The Backend
.IP \- 3
\fBflexiblas_set_num_threads\fR (3), Change the number of threads in the backend used for computation.
.IP \- 3
\fBflexiblas_get_num_threads\fR (3), Get the number of threads in the backend used for computation.
