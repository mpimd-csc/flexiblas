.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBflexiblas_load_backend\fR loads a backend from the FlexiBLAS configuration. The \fIname\fR
parameter specifies the name of the backend inside the configuration. The available backends
can be access via \fBflexiblas_list\fR. Except of some special backends, like the
upcoming CUBLAS backend the backend is initialized during the load. The name of the backend
is not case sensitive.


.SH RETURN VALUE
On success, it returns the \fBid\fR of the loaded backend which is used within a later call
to \fBflexiblas_switch\fR to change the backend.

If the requested backend can not be found in the configuration, an error is returned.

.SH ERRORS

All negative return values are errors and can not be used as an \fBid\fR for \fBflexiblas_switch\fR.
